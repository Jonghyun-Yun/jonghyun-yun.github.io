In the first week, we will have a refresher on the commands in R which you will need to use in the following weeks, but this is not a comprehensive R course, and we will not go in depth on R syntax. Please see online R resources listed in the course website.\nStudent Learning Outcomes Upon successful completion of the requirements for this course, students should have the knowledge and skills to\n Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods and other sources of statistical bias, and determine their implications and how they affect the scope of inference. Use statistical software \u0026reg; to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis. Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions. Model numerical response variables using a single explanatory variable or multiple explanatory variables in order to investigate relationships between variables. Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon. Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.  Grading The usual grading scale will be used for this course.\n   A B C D F     100-90 89-80 79-70 69-60 below 60    Grade Distribution  40% Homework assignments 5% Quizzes 20% Midterm exam 35% Final exam  Homework There will be 8 homework assignments and a final homework assignment. One lowest homework score will be dropped, but you cannot drop the final homework. Late coursework will not be accepted without a university approved excuse. It is imperative that you show all your work; simply stating an answer will result in no credit for the problem. You are encouraged to work with each other on the homework problems, but you must turn in your own work.\nDigital Distractions You are encouraged to bring your mobile devices to class. Mobile devices are to be used only for purposes directly related to the class content and information. You may not view or respond to emails during class. You may not conduct unrelated searches during class. Cellphones should be turned to vibrate while in class and on silent or off when students are presenting. No phone calls should be accepted, only in case of an emergency.\nLecture Attendance At the University of Texas at Arlington, taking attendance is not required. Rather, each faculty member is free to develop his or her own methods of evaluating students\u0026rsquo; academic performance, which includes establishing course-specific policies on attendance. As the instructor of this section, I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures. You are responsible for any and all announcements made in class. You are also responsible for any material missed during class.\nDrop Policy Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of the registration period through the late registration period. After the late registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way through the term or session. It is the student\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to officially withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. Students will not be automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of financial aid administered through the University may be required as the result of dropping classes or withdrawing. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (http://wweb.uta.edu/aao/fao/).\nDisability Accommodations UT Arlington is on record as being committed to both the spirit and letter of all federal equal opportunity legislation, including The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), The Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act (ADAAA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. All instructors at UT Arlington are required by law to provide “reasonable accommodations” to students with disabilities, so as not to discriminate on the basis of disability. Students are responsible for providing the instructor with official notification in the form of a letter certified by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). Only those students who have officially documented a need for an accommodation will have their request honored.

I will follow the highest standards of integrity and uphold the spirit of the Honor Code.\n UT Arlington faculty members may employ the Honor Code as they see fit in their courses, including (but not limited to) having students acknowledge the honor code as part of an examination or requiring students to incorporate the honor code into any work submitted. Per UT System Regents\u0026rsquo; Rule 50101, §2.2, suspected violations of university\u0026rsquo;s standards for academic integrity (including the Honor Code) will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Violators will be disciplined in accordance with University policy, which may result in the student\u0026rsquo;s suspension or expulsion from the University.\nElectronic Communication UT Arlington has adopted MavMail as its official means to communicate with students about important deadlines and events, as well as to transact university-related business regarding financial aid, tuition, grades, graduation, etc. All students are assigned a MavMail account and are responsible for checking the inbox regularly. There is no additional charge to students for using this account, which remains active even after graduation. Information about activating and using MavMail is available at http://www.uta.edu/oit/cs/email/mavmail.php.\nCampus Carry Effective August 1, 2016, the Campus Carry law (Senate Bill 11) allows those licensed individuals to carry a concealed handgun in buildings on public university campuses, except in locations the University establishes as prohibited. Under the new law, openly carrying handguns is not allowed on college campuses. For more information, visit http://www.uta.edu/news/info/campus-carry/\nStudent Feedback Survey At the end of each term, students enrolled in classes categorized as “lecture,”“seminar,” or “laboratory” shall be directed to complete an online Student Feedback Survey (SFS). Instructions on how to access the SFS for this course will be sent directly to each student through MavMail approximately 10 days before the end of the term. Each student’s feedback enters the SFS database anonymously and is aggregated with that of other students enrolled in the course. UT Arlington’s effort to solicit, gather, tabulate, and publish student feedback is required by state law; students are strongly urged to participate. For more information, visit http://www.uta.edu/sfs.\nFinal Review Week A period of five class days prior to the first day of final examinations in the long sessions shall be designated as Final Review Week. The purpose of this week is to allow students sufficient time to prepare for final examinations. During this week, there shall be no scheduled activities such as required field trips or performances; and no instructor shall assign any themes, research problems or exercises of similar scope that have a completion date during or following this week unless specified in the class syllabus. During Final Review Week, an instructor shall not give any examinations constituting 10% or more of the final grade, except makeup tests and laboratory examinations. In addition, no instructor shall give any portion of the final examination during Final Review Week. During this week, classes are held as scheduled. In addition, instructors are not required to limit content to topics that have been previously covered; they may introduce new concepts as appropriate.\nEmergency Exit Procedures Should we experience an emergency event that requires us to vacate the building, students should exit the room and take an immediate right or left, and walk toward the corner of the building. When exiting the building during an emergency, one should never take an elevator but should use the stairwells. Faculty members and instructional staff will assist students in selecting the safest route for evacuation and will make arrangements to assist individuals with disabilities.

The current available proposal distributions depend either only on the state dynamics, or only on the observation, or on both sources of information but are not available for general SSMs. In this article, we develop a new particle filtering algorithm, called the augmented particle filter (APF), for online filtering problems in SSMs. The APF combines two sets of particles from the observation equation and the state equation, and the state space is augmented to facilitate the weight computation. Theoretical justification of the APF is provided, and the connection between the APF and the optimal particle filter (OPF) in some special SSMs is investigated. The APF shares similar properties as the OPF, but the APF can be applied to a much wider range of models than the OPF. Simulation studies show that the APF performs similarly to or better than the OPF when the OPF is available, and the APF can perform better than other filtering algorithms in the literature when the OPF is not available.","tags":[],"title":"Augmented particle filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Yun","T Wang","G Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and \\(\\rm \\LaTeX\\) math code.\n","date":1393221600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567111973,"objectID":"324c800f9e0c217a092f306f9aa333cd","permalink":"//jonghyun-yun.github.io/publication/hmm-clip/","publishdate":"2014-02-24T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hmm-clip/","section":"publication","summary":"The photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) has been increasingly used for the global mapping of RNA-protein interaction sites. There are two key features of the PAR-CLIP experiments: The sequence read tags are likely to form an enriched peak around each RNA-protein interaction site; and the cross-linking procedure is likely to introduce a specific mutation in each sequence read tag at the interaction site. Several ad hoc methods have been developed to identify the RNA-protein interaction sites using either sequence read counts or mutation counts alone; however, rigorous statistical methods for analyzing PAR-CLIP are still lacking. In this study, we propose an integrative model to establish a joint distribution of observed read and mutation counts. To pinpoint the interaction sites at single base-pair resolution, we developed a novel modeling approach that adopts non-homogeneous hidden Markov models to incorporate the nucleotide sequence at each genomic location. Both simulation studies and data application showed that our method outperforms the ad hoc methods, and provides reliable inferences for the RNA-protein binding sites from PAR-CLIP data.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Hidden Markov Models to Identify RNA-Protein Interaction Sites in PAR-CLIP","type":"publication"}]
