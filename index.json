The current available proposal distributions depend either only on the state dynamics, or only on the observation, or on both sources of information but are not available for general SSMs. In this article, we develop a new particle filtering algorithm, called the augmented particle filter (APF), for online filtering problems in SSMs. The APF combines two sets of particles from the observation equation and the state equation, and the state space is augmented to facilitate the weight computation. Theoretical justification of the APF is provided, and the connection between the APF and the optimal particle filter (OPF) in some special SSMs is investigated. The APF shares similar properties as the OPF, but the APF can be applied to a much wider range of models than the OPF. Simulation studies show that the APF performs similarly to or better than the OPF when the OPF is available, and the APF can perform better than other filtering algorithms in the literature when the OPF is not available.","tags":[],"title":"Augmented particle filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Yun","T Wang","G Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and \\(\\rm \\LaTeX\\) math code.\n","date":1393221600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585194206,"objectID":"324c800f9e0c217a092f306f9aa333cd","permalink":"/publication/hmm-clip/","publishdate":"2014-02-24T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hmm-clip/","section":"publication","summary":"The photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) has been increasingly used for the global mapping of RNA-protein interaction sites. There are two key features of the PAR-CLIP experiments: The sequence read tags are likely to form an enriched peak around each RNA-protein interaction site; and the cross-linking procedure is likely to introduce a specific mutation in each sequence read tag at the interaction site. Several ad hoc methods have been developed to identify the RNA-protein interaction sites using either sequence read counts or mutation counts alone; however, rigorous statistical methods for analyzing PAR-CLIP are still lacking. In this study, we propose an integrative model to establish a joint distribution of observed read and mutation counts. To pinpoint the interaction sites at single base-pair resolution, we developed a novel modeling approach that adopts non-homogeneous hidden Markov models to incorporate the nucleotide sequence at each genomic location. Both simulation studies and data application showed that our method outperforms the ad hoc methods, and provides reliable inferences for the RNA-protein binding sites from PAR-CLIP data.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Hidden Markov Models to Identify RNA-Protein Interaction Sites in PAR-CLIP","type":"publication"}]
